Not Available Food Interactions Not Available Categories Drug Categories Not Available Chemical Taxonomy Provided by  Classyfire Description This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as macrolactams. These are cyclic amides of amino carboxylic acids, having a 1-azacycloalkan-2-one structure, or analogues having unsaturation or heteroatoms replacing one or more carbon atoms of the ring. They are nitrogen analogues (the a nitrogen atom replacing the o atom of the cyclic carboxylic acid group ) of the naturally occurring macrolides.
