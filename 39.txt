Not Available Food Interactions Not Available Categories Drug Categories Not Available Chemical Taxonomy Provided by  Classyfire Description This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phosphatidylglycerols. These are glycerophosphoglycerols in which two fatty acids are bonded to the 1-glycerol moiety through ester linkages. As is the case with diacylglycerols, phosphatidylglycerols can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached to the C-1 and C-2 positions.
